## Bio

I'm a computational epidemiologist and data scientist working at the intersection of AI/ML, computational dynamics and public health. I am the author of [Computational Modeling of Infectious Disease](https://computationalinfectiousdisease.com), a richly illustrated compendium on modern computational epidemiology, as well as [a growing body of research](papers).

I attended the University  of Oxford for my undergraduate studies, graduating with a distinction (1st class), and returned there for my graduate studies. I also hold degrees from Cardiff and Robert Gordon University Aberdeen, and have studied at the University of Leiden under an Erasmus programme. Today, I am [board certified in public health](https://cph.nbphe.org/employer_letter/19626), a Fellow of the [Royal Society for Public Health](https://www.rsph.org.uk/) and a member of several other learned societies.

I am currently a Practice Director for Biomedical AI/ML for [HCLTech](https://www.hcltech.com/), where I advise the world's leading life sciences, medical devices and pharma companies on how to leverage AI/ML to improve their products and serve their customers better. I am also a visiting thesis supervisor for students on the data science track of the mathematics programme at the [Budapest University of Technology and Economics](https://www.bme.hu/?language=en).

As part of my service to the profession, I've been a reviewer for [JOSS](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/reviewed_by/@chrisvoncsefalvay), [Frontiers in Immunology](https://loop.frontiersin.org/people/1398311/editorial) and [Frontiers in Medicine](https://loop.frontiersin.org/people/1398311/editorial). Between 2022 and 2023, I served Virginia as a member of the Medical Reserve Corps, and currently serve in both the Rocky Mountain MRC of Denver and Colorado's radiation response MRC. I was also part of the [COVID-19 Healthcare Coalition](https://c19hcc.org/) and the [Covid Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/thank-you#chris-von-csefalvay). 

You can find a [list of my publications here](papers). My work on COVID-19 has been [featured in the media](media). I also write on various topics as the fancy strikes -- you can peruse my [notebook](blog) here.
